# 🛡️ Face Mask Detection using Computer Vision
This project is an implementation of a face mask detection system using a machine learning model (CNN/U-Net) built with TensorFlow/Keras. The application can be run through a simple web interface that uses a webcam to perform real-time detection.

# 🚀 Features
📸 Real-time face mask detection from webcam feed. <br/>
🖥️ Modern and responsive web interface.
🤖 Deep learning model implemented in .h5 format (CNN/U-Net).
💻 Easy to run locally.

# 🧠 Technologies Used
-Backend: Flask (Python)
-Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-Machine Learning: TensorFlow / Keras
-Computer Vision: OpenCV
-Webcam API: getUserMedia
