# 🛡️ Face Mask Detection using Computer Vision

This project is an implementation of a face mask detection system using a machine learning model (CNN/U-Net) built with TensorFlow/Keras. The application can be run through a simple web interface that uses a webcam to perform real-time detection.

## 📸 Key Features

-Real-time face mask detection from webcam input
-Modern and responsive web interface
-Machine learning model implementation in .h5 format
-Easy to run locally

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Front-End)
- Flask (Back-End Web)
- Webcam API (getUserMedia)
